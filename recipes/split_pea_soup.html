    <p>
      This is a wonderful, hearty split pea soup. Great for a fall or blustery
      winter day.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 (1 lb.) smoked ham hock</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
      <li>2 medium leeks (white and pale green parts only), thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 large shallots, minced</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 lb. dried green split peas</li>
      <li>8 c. low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add ham hock and
        cook, turning occasionally, until golden on all sides, about 6 minutes
        total. Remove ham hock from pot and add remaining oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onions, leeks, and shallots to the pot and season with salt and
        pepper. Cook until tender, 6 minutes more. Add split peas, chicken
        stock, thyme, bay leaves, and seared ham hock to the pot and bring to a
        boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally until peas are
        tender, about 1 hour. (If the soup gets too thick, add water 1/2 cup at
        a time until desired thickness is reached.)
      </li>
      <li>
        When peas are tender, remove bay leaf, thyme, and ham hock. Remove any
        meat from ham hock and shred. Use an immersion blender or countertop
        blender to purée roughly 1/4 of the soup. Return puréed soup to pot
        along with the shredded ham hock and season to taste with salt and
        pepper. Served topped with more fresh thyme and another crack of black
        pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
